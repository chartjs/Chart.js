## Bugs & issues

When reporting bugs or issues, if you could include a link to a simple [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or similar demonstrating the issue, that'd be really helpful.

This project is modular and supports separately-maintained new chart types. This project's scope includes only the chart types included. New chart types should be created and maintained in separate repositories. We may consider linking to them from this project if they incude passing build tests and have complete documentation. Please discuss new or "missing" chart types in the [Chart.js User Discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chartjs-user-discussion) Google Group and not in Issues. For more information, please also see the CONTRIBUTING file.
