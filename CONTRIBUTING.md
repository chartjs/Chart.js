Contributing to Chart.js
========================

Contributions to Chart.js are welcome and encouraged, but please have a look through the guidelines in this document before raising an issue, or writing code for the project.


Using issues
------------

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/issues) is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests.

If you're suggesting a new chart type, please take a look at [writing new chart types](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#writing-new-chart-types) in the documentation, and some of the [community extensions](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#community-extensions) that have been created already.

To keep the library lightweight for everyone, it's unlikely we'll add many more chart types to the core of Chart.js, but issues are a good medium to design and spec out how new chart types could work and look.

Please do not use issues for support requests. For help using Chart.js, please take a look at the [`chartjs`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chartjs) tag on Stack Overflow.


Reporting bugs
--------------

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidlines for reporting bugs:

 - Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported
 - Isolate the problem to a simple test case
 - Provide a demonstration of the problem on [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com) or similar

Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's browser or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.


Pull requests
-------------

Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project's community driven growth. But please review [these guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.

Guidlines:

 - Please create an issue first:
   - For bugs, we can discuss the fixing approach
   - For enhancements, we can discuss if it is within the project scope and avoid duplicate effort
 - Please make changes to the files in [`/src`](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/tree/master/src), not `Chart.js` or `Chart.min.js` in the repo root directory, this avoids merge conflicts
 - Tabs for indentation, not spaces please
 - If adding new functionality, please also update the relevant `.md` file in the  [`/docs`](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/tree/master/docs) folder
 - Please make your commits in logical sections with clear commit messages
