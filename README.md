## Bugs & issues

When reporting bugs or issues, if you could include a link to a simple [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or similar demonstrating the issue, that'd be really helpful.


## Contributing
New contributions to the library are welcome, just a couple of guidelines:

- Tabs for indentation, not spaces please.
- Please ensure you're changing the individual files in `/src`, not the concatenated output in the `Chart.js` file in the root of the repo.
- Please check that your code will pass `jshint` code standards, `gulp jshint` will run this for you.
- Please keep pull requests concise, and document new functionality in the relevant `.md` file.
- Consider whether your changes are useful for all users, or if creating a Chart.js extension would be more appropriate.
- For new chart types or functional changes, please add a demo link using [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) or similar.
