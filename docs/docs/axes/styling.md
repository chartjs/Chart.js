title: Styling

There are a number of options to allow styling an axis. There are settings to control [grid lines](#grid-line-configuration) and [ticks](#tick-configuration).

## Grid Line Configuration

The grid line configuration is nested under the scale configuration in the `gridLines` key. It defines options for the grid lines that run perpendicular to the axis.

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| `display` | `boolean` | `true` | If false, do not display grid lines for this axis.
| `borderColor` | `Color` | | If set, used as the color of the border line. If unset, the first `color` option is resolved and used.
| `borderWidth` | `number` | | If set, used as the width of the border line. If unset, the first `lineWidth` option is resolved and used.
| `circular` | `boolean` | `false` | If true, gridlines are circular (on radar chart only).
| `color` | <code>Color&#124;Color[]&#124;function</code> | `'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'` | The color of the grid lines. If specified as an array, the first color applies to the first grid line, the second to the second grid line and so on.
| `borderDash` | `number[]` | `[]` | Length and spacing of dashes on grid lines. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/setLineDash).
| `borderDashOffset` | <code>number&#124;function</code> | `0.0` | Offset for line dashes. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineDashOffset).
| `lineWidth` | <code>number&#124;number[]&#124;function</code> | `1` | Stroke width of grid lines.
| `drawBorder` | `boolean` | `true` | If true, draw border at the edge between the axis and the chart area.
| `drawOnChartArea` | `boolean` | `true` | If true, draw lines on the chart area inside the axis lines. This is useful when there are multiple axes and you need to control which grid lines are drawn.
| `drawTicks` | `boolean` | `true` | If true, draw lines beside the ticks in the axis area beside the chart.
| `tickMarkLength` | `number` | `10` | Length in pixels that the grid lines will draw into the axis area.
| `offsetGridLines` | `boolean` | `false` | If true, grid lines will be shifted to be between labels. This is set to `true` for a bar chart by default.
| `z` | `number` | `0` | z-index of gridline layer. Values &lt;= 0 are drawn under datasets, &gt; 0 on top.

For function arguments, the function is passed a context object that is of the form:

```javscript
{
    scale: // Scale object
    tick: // Tick object
}
```

## Tick Configuration

The tick configuration is nested under the scale configuration in the `ticks` key. It defines options for the tick marks that are generated by the axis.

| Name | Type | [Scriptable](#scriptable-options) | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| `callback` | `function` | | | Returns the string representation of the tick value as it should be displayed on the chart. See [callback](../axes/labelling.md#creating-custom-tick-formats).
| `display` | `boolean` | | `true` | If true, show tick labels.
| `font` | `Font` | Yes | `defaults.font` | See [Fonts](fonts.md)
| `major` | `object` | | `{}` | Major ticks configuration.
| `padding` | `number` | | `0` | Sets the offset of the tick labels from the axis
| `reverse` | `boolean` | | `false` | Reverses order of tick labels.
| `z` | `number` | | `0` | z-index of tick layer. Useful when ticks are drawn on chart area. Values &lt;= 0 are drawn under datasets, &gt; 0 on top.

## Major Tick Configuration

The majorTick configuration is nested under the ticks configuration in the `major` key. It defines options for the major tick marks that are generated by the axis.

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | If true, major ticks are generated. A major tick will affect autoskipping and `major` will be defined on ticks in the scriptable options context.

## Scriptable Options

Scriptable options also accept a function which is called for each of the underlying data values and that takes the unique argument `context` representing contextual information (see [option context](#option-context)).

Example (using `'bold'` style from major ticks and default style for minor):

```javascript {10-12}
const cfg = {
    data: {/* ... */},
    options: {
        scales: {
            x: {
                ticks: {
                    major: {
                        enabled: true,
                    },
                    font: function(context) {
                        return context.tick.major ? {style: "bold"} : undefined;
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
};
```

## Tick Option Context

The option context is used to give contextual information when resolving options and applies only to [scriptable options](#scriptable-options).

The context object contains the following properties:

- `chart`: the associated chart
- `scale`: the associated scale
- `index`: index of the current tick
- `tick`: the associated Tick object: `{value:any, label?:string, major?:boolean}`

**Important**: since the context can represent different types of entities (dataset, data, ticks, etc.), some properties may be `undefined` so be sure to test any context property before using it.
