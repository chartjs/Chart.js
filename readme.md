Project goal:
--------------------
This project is maintained as the canonical fork of mature <a href="https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js">nnnick/Chart.js</a> project because the author has gone missing to work on an even-stalled rewrite but many contributors are ready to help out now. The <a href="https://github.com/fulldecent/Chart.js/tree/master">master branch</a> here is solely a continuation of the original Chart.js project and allows contributors to submit pull requests to an active project. Only the following are in-scope for master:

 * Bug fixes
 * Documentation improvements
 * Stabitily fixes
 * Continuous integration testing

Don't even think about submitting code that changes functionality without updating ALL relevant documentation and unit tests.

You are welcome to discuss refactoring here and we will make branches for collaboration on any cool ideas. But remember, the main goal of this project is to wait for Nick to come back from hibernation and say "thanks for all your hard work, here is a patchset to fix all your issues which has no controversy and is ready and field tested."
