  Hey there! 

  If you need help or tech support then this is not the place to ask. Please post
  a question to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chart.js or head over
  to our Slack workspace at https://chartjs-slack.herokuapp.com/.

  You maximize your chances of having your question answered if you follow
  StackOverflow's guidelines: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask.
  If your question was not answered on StackOverflow, that does not mean you 
  should post it here. If you do, it will be immediately closed.

  Chart.js users vastly outnumber our small number of volunteer maintainers and 
  we try to help as many users as we can, but we may not get to every question. 
  Chart.js is a community project. You can contribute towards the goal of helping
  every user by asking good questions, answering questions on StackOverflow
  or Slack, creating an issue or pull request for the documentation, or otherwise
  contributing to the project:
