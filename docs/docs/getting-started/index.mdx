Let's get started using Chart.js!

First, we need to have a canvas in our page. It's recommended to give the chart its own container for [responsiveness](../general/responsive.md).

```html
<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>
```

Now that we have a canvas we can use, we need to include Chart.js in our page.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

Now, we can create a chart. We add a script to our page:

import { useEffect } from 'react';

```jsx live
function example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
    var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
      // The type of chart we want to create
      type: 'line',

      // The data for our dataset
      data: {
        labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'],
        datasets: [{
          label: 'My First dataset',
          backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
          borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
          data: [0, 10, 5, 2, 20, 30, 45]
        }]
      },

      // Configuration options go here
      options: {}
    });
    return () => chart.destroy();
  });
  return <div className="chartjs-wrapper"><canvas id="myChart" className="chartjs"></canvas></div>;
}
```

It's that easy to get started using Chart.js! From here you can explore the many options that can help you customise your charts with scales, tooltips, labels, colors, custom actions, and much more.

All our examples are [available online](https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/) but you can also download the `Chart.js.zip` archive attached to every [release](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases) to experiment with our samples locally from the `/samples` folder.
