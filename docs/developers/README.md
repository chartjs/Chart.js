# Developers

Developer features allow extending and enhancing Chart.js in many different ways.

# Latest documentation

The latest version of the documentation, including unreleased features, is always available at the [documentation master](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/master/).

# Testing development releases

Tools like [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io) allow quick prototying and validation of Chart.js functionalities. One common problem is that this requires the built version of the Chart.js library.

Latest builds are available for testing at:

 - http://chartjs.org/dist/master/Chart.min.js
 - http://chartjs.org/dist/master/Chart.bundle.min.js

*Note*: These development builds are only available via HTTP. In order to include them in JSFiddle or CodePen, these need to be accessed via HTTP, too. The development build MUST not be used for production purposes or as replacement for CDN.

# Browser support

Chart.js offers support for all browsers where canvas is supported.

Browser support for the canvas element is available in all modern & major mobile browsers. [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)

Thanks to [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) for allowing our team to test on thousands of browsers.

# Previous versions

Version 2 has a completely different API than earlier versions.

Most earlier version options have current equivalents or are the same.

Please use the documentation that is available on [chartjs.org](http://www.chartjs.org/docs/) for the current version of Chart.js.

Please note - documentation for previous versions are available on the GitHub repo.
