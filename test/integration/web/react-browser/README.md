# Testing internal changes for bundlers on the web.

If you want to test how bundled code responds to the changes you made you can test that in this sample project.
You can do this by edetiting the files in `node_modules/chart.js` with the same changes you made in the source files. After this you can run `npm run start` to start the dev server with your adjusted files to see the effects.
