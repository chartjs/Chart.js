### Introduction
Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value.

This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.

<div class="canvas-holder">
	<canvas width="250" height="125"></canvas>
</div>

### Example usage

```javascript
new Chart(ctx, {
	data:data, 
	type: 'polarArea',
	options: options
});
```

### Data structure

```javascript
var data = {
	datasets: [{
		data: [
			10,
			32,
			53,
			14,
			22,
		],
		backgroundColor: [
			"#F7464A",
			"#46BFBD",
			"#FDB45C",
			"#949FB1",
			"#4D5360",
		],
		label: 'My dataset' // for legend
	}],
	labels: [
		"Red",
		"Green",
		"Yellow",
		"Grey",
		"Dark Grey"
	]
};
```
As you can see, for the chart data you pass in an array of objects, with a value and a colour. The value attribute should be a number, while the color attribute should be a string. Similar to CSS, for this string you can use HEX notation, RGB, RGBA or HSL.

### Chart options

These are the customisation options specific to Polar Area charts. These options are merged with the [global chart configuration options](#getting-started-global-chart-configuration), and form the options of the chart.

Name | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
scale | Array | [See Scales](#scales) and [Defaults for Radial Linear Scale](#getting-started-radial-linear-scale) | Options for the one scale used on the chart. Use this to style the ticks, labels, and grid.
*scale*.type | String |"radialLinear" | As defined in ["Radial Linear"](#scales-radial-linear-scale).
*scale*.lineArc | Boolean | true | When true, lines are circular.
animateRotate | Boolean |true | If true, will animate the rotation of the chart.
animateScale | Boolean | true | If true, will animate scaling the chart.
*legend*.*labels*.generateLabels | Function | `function(data) {} ` | Returns labels for each the legend
*legend*.onClick | Function | function(event, legendItem) {} ` | Handles clicking an individual legend item
legendCallback | Function | `function(chart) ` | Generates the HTML legend via calls to `generateLegend`

You can override these for your `Chart` instance by passing a second argument into the `PolarArea` method as an object with the keys you want to override.

For example, we could have a polar area chart with a black stroke on each segment like so:

```javascript
new Chart(ctx, {
	data: data,
	type: 'polarArea',
	options: {
		elements: {
			arc: {
				borderColor: "#000000"
			}
		}
	}
});
// This will create a chart with all of the default options, merged from the global config,
// and the PolarArea chart defaults but this particular instance will have `elements.arc.borderColor` set to `"#000000"`.
```

We can also change these defaults values for each PolarArea type that is created, this object is available at `Chart.defaults.polarArea`.
